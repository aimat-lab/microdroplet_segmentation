# Micro-droplet Segmentation in Microscopy Images

Semi-supervised tool for segmentation of micro-droplet arrays in microscopy images. 
This data analysis tool was developed to automatically detect and evaluate droplet stained by fluorescence markers.

# Requirements 

Required packages for this project can be installed with ``pip`` and are listed below. 
The GUI uses ``matplotlib`` and image processing is handled by `opencv` and ``. 
The code is tested on Windows machines to run on lab computers, where python is available in system PATH environment variable!

```shell
python -m pip install opencv-python
python -m pip install openpyxl
python -m pip install matplotlib
python -m pip install scikit-image
```
